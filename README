How to build:

0) Geant4 must be installed on your system, and the appropriate environment
   variables (G4INSTALL, G4LIB, etc.) must be set.
1) create a Geant4 working directory in your home directory and set the
   environment variable G4WORKDIR to this directory.
     Example:
      > mkdir $HOME/geant4
      > export G4WORKDIR=$HOME/geant4
   The working directory is used in the build process to store intermediate
   object files (in $G4WORKDIR/tmp/) and the resulting executable (in
   $G4WORKDIR/bin/).
3) run "make" in your local sim/DressedSpin/shared directory.  If successful, the
   library "libdressedSpin.a" will be created in $G4WORKDIR/tmp/Linux-g++.
4) cd to one of the application directories, say "sim/DressedSpin/example",
   and run make.  This creates an executable in $G4WORKDIR/bin/Linux-g++
5) you may want to add the directory $G4WORKDIR/bin/Linux-g++ to your
   PATH environment variable:
      > export PATH=$PATH:$G4WORKDIR/bin/Linux-g++


**********************************************************************
The application executable can be run either interactively or
(more conveniently) in batch mode.

How to run in batch mode:
     Example:
      > sim_example test.mac temp.root

1) The optional macro file should be in the standard Geant4 format of a
   procedural list of commands.  The program exits after the last command
   is completed.
2) The optional ROOT filename is the name of the output file
   ("temp.root" by default) which contains histograms created and filled
   in the simulation.


**********************************************************************
To create your own application, copy one of the existing application
directories and all its contents to a new directory, e.g.
"cp -r example/ MyApp/" from within the sim/DressedSpin directory.
Modify the code in your new directory as desired, change the name
in the GNUMakefile ("name := sim_MyApp"), and run make.
