To run, specify some combination of input files a.mac and b.mac,
and output file c.root, where a,b,c stand for the actual file names.
e.g., "beamExpt a.mac b.dat c.root"
 
All files are optional.
  1) If the macro file a.mac is omitted, an interactive session will
     be started.
  2) If the macro file a.mac is specified AND so is the velocity
     distribution data file b.dat, the simulation will loop over
     the lines in b.dat and put the weighted sums of the spins
     components (at the detector) in the histogram hAccumSpin.
     The format of b.dat is:
        [velocity (m/s)]  [weight]
  3) If no ROOT output filename is specified, it will be set to
     "temp.root" in the current directory.
